# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!! DON'T USE IT YET, HELP IS WELCOME<!-- omit in toc -->

# WordPress Skeleton <!-- omit in toc -->

Maybe not a complete solution for managing WordPress as a nerd but close to it ðŸ¤“

This repo is intended to be used as a starter point when developing a new site but also easy enough to convert an existing project to this workflow.

What this project tries to achieve is to give you a way to be sure that you have
as much as possible under control when managing WordPress sites from the developer's perspective.

[TODO] I'll make a micro site to explain the whys and hows of this project. For now basic usage instructions will be given in this readme file to use it.

# Disclaimer

This setup might not be suitable for all kinds of environments or may need some adjustments to work properly with your either local or production server.

Pull requests are welcome as long as they are addressing compatibility issues, fixing bugs or adding features that will make it more flexible. Any PR that just changes stuff to make it work with a specific environment will be rejected, instead find a proper way to provide compatibility with that environment without breaking others.

# Usage

## Install

1. Clone this repository `git clone REPO_LINK my-project`
2. Run `composer install`
3. Rename `.env.example` and `wp-cli.yml.example` to `.env` and `wp-cli.yml`
4. Create your database if you haven't already
5. Fill in the details in `.env` and `wp-cli.yml` for the environment you're working on
6. Point your web root to the `/public` directory
7. Now visit the website and follow install instructions or import your database
8. Optionally, you can import the official WPTRT dummy data to have something to work with

Bonus: To fix weird behaviours with WP-ClirRename `wp-cli.yml.example` to `wp-cli.yml` and edit contents accordingly.

# Deploy

For the deploying process we opted for [Deployer](https://deployer.org/) because of its ease of use, the built-in atomic deployments (aka zero downtime deployments) and it's free!

Deployer is required dev dependency.

## Asumptions

- You have SSH access to the server
- You have an SSH key on the server linked to your GitHub account/repository for the pulls. (I'll make a tuto on this one)

Note: If you're running on production copy `local-config.sample.php` to `production-config.php`.

## Usage
Deployer will help you with the deployment of the site (just the files for now).

Basically the way Deployer works is:
1. It connects via SSH to your server
2. Clones your repository on the server
3. Installs dependencies
4. Symlinks the `current` folder to the latest release

That means you need to trigger the deploy manually, it will not pull the repo whenever you push to master/production/whatever-branch-you-set (aka Push To Deploy).

## First use
First of all open a terminal, cd into your project if you haven't already and check that you have access to the tool by typing `dep test`

You should be getting this output:
```shell
$ dep test
âž¤ Executing task test
Hello world! ðŸ¤“
âœ” Ok
```

If you don't deployer installed globally use `vendor/bin/dep test`

Once you get that output we know Deployer is reachable and ready to get instructions.

Now rename `hosts.yml.example` to `hosts.yml` and fill in the server details.
If you want more info about the available options and how it works read the [Deployer docs](https://deployer.org/docs/hosts.html).

### hosts.yml

In this file you store all the info that Deployer needs to deploy your site on your server. The info provided is for just one server but you can extend it to have multiple server or even multiple stages on same or different servers.

## First deployment
**Check that your webroot on the server is pointing to `â€¦/current/public`**

Once again check you've got your `hosts.yml` details in and you filled the `# Deploy Settings` block of the `.env` file and then ðŸ”¥

`$ dep deploy production`  
or  
`$ vendor/bin/dep deploy production`

If everything went well you should see the entire process going on your terminal.

If it doesn't read the errors, fix them and try again, still not working? Re-read the errors fix them and try again. Still not ðŸ¤¬ working? Open an issue and I will try to help.
