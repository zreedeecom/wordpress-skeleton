# WordPress Skeleton <!-- omit in toc -->

Maybe not a complete solution for managing WordPress as a nerd but close to it ðŸ¤“

This repo is intended to be used as a starter point when developing a new site but also easy enough to convert an existing project to this workflow.

What this project tries to achieve is to give you a way to be sure that you have
as much as possible under control when managing WordPress sites from the developer's perspective.

[TODO] I'll make a micro site to explain the whys and hows of this project. For now basic usage instructions will be given in this readme file to use it.

# Disclaimer

This setup might not be suitable for all kinds of environments or may need some adjustments to work properly with your either local or production server.

Pull requests are welcome as long as they are addressing compatibility issues, fixing bugs or adding features that will make it more flexible. Any PR that just changes stuff to make it work with a specific environment will be rejected, instead find a proper way to provide compatibility with that environment without breaking others.

# Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `composer install`
3. Copy `local-config.sample.php` to `local-config.php` and fill in the details
4. Point your web root to the `/public` directory

Note: If you're running on production copy `local-config.sample.php` to `production-config.php`.

# Deploy

For the deploying process we opted for [Deployer](https://deployer.org/) because of its ease of use, the built-in atomic deployments (aka zero downtime deployments) and it's free!
